		<p>I grew up in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, where morning are sunny and the afternoons are stormy. My parents work, and still work, at the local university, and I remember spending a significant amount of time of their campus in my childhood. My parents were really invested in my academic success which I think is rooted in them being successful in academia themselves. I didn’t mind the extra push as a kid because I liked school, being in the classroom, and learning about what teachers would lecture about. I was also pretty involved in school in things like Math Olympiad and Science Club, but my favorite memories are of when I was in orchestra playing the viola. The music program I was in really helped me develop my appreciation for music, and motivated me to be better in all aspects of my life.
