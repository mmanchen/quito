		<p>My name is Maria Mancheno and I’m from Quito, Ecuador. I’m 21 years old and I currently go to the University of Rochester. My major is in Digital Media Studies and I’m also doing a minor in Math. My hobbies include playing soccer, playing the guitar and reading. I work as a social media manager and web developer at the Peak Lab in the University of Rochester Medical Center. This last summer I had the opportunity to do an internship in an Ecuadorian firm where I was able to improve my programming skills. My favorite thing is to travel around the world to learn about new cultures and meet new interesting people.
