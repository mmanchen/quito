		<p>Hi you guys! My name's Pancho I am a 5 year old corgi, beagle, and bulldog mix. I am originally from Virginia and I was brought to Rochester by a rescue shelter association. 
			I recently discovered I like fighting frozen brocoli, and I constantly try to catch flys around the house. 
			Because of my past homes I am scared of a lot of things, and I often bark at statues, benches, insects, and the vacuum cleaner.
