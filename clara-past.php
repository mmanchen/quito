		<h1> Before my Forever Home </h1>

		<p>As I mentioned before I am originally from Virginia. I had a family that didn't have a lot of time for me and often lost patience. One day they could no longer take care of me and abandonned me in the streets, like it is the case for a lot of dogs in the area. I was put into a local shelter, but since I was never socialized with humans or dogs, I am pretty scared and it's hard for me to trust someone which makes it hard for me to get adopted. So after a few months I was taken to a high kill shelter in North Virginia. Lucky for me, a Rochester shelter was taking dog that were in death row into foster homes and I was a lucky winner. I spent another few months in the foster home trying to look for my forever owner, but none of them were a match. One day, this girl came in, and the moment she walked in I knew she was the one. When they opened my cage so we could meet, I couldn't contain my excitement and ran as fast as I could and jumped on the couch to nuzzle and nuzzle her forever. And well...the rest is history. We are best buddys! I still attend aggression classes so I can learn to not be scared of other dogs and humans, but I'm getting so much better! Just excited to finally get as much playtime and attention as I deserve hehe.</p>
