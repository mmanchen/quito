		<h1> Famous Lifestyle </h1>

		<p>The thing about me is that I'm funny & fabulous! I have a big personality, and according to everyone that meets me, I am constantly doing silly things. I like to fight fruits and vegetables, do yoga in the mornings, and sleep like a weird T-Rex at night. So, as you can imagine, that led to everyone that meets me being obsessed with me. One thing led to another one, and I ended up being Insta famous. Now I have over 50 different bandanas that I like to model and change every week. I will say tho, the fashion life is hard sometimes.</p>
