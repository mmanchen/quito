		<h1>My favorite things</h1>
		<p>
			My favorite morning hobby is peeing in as many trees as I can during my river side morning walk. This takes a lot of careful planning because walks aren't the same length everyday so, I have to calculate precisely.
			Afternoons are fun because gets back from school. Then, we get to play ball and tug of war until I get tired and then I usually get a nice good boy massage.
			Weekends are the best!!! Mom works at the Farmer's Market and I always get a surprise!! The other farmer's always ask about me and always give mom bones, meat, treats, or some fun toy.
			But if I had to pick nights are my favorite. I get a Dentastix while mom brushes her teeth so, one could say we brush our teeth at the same time. Then she gets in bed and I impatiently dance at the bottom until she fixes the blankets and pads the bed as a signal for me to jump up. Then I crowl into a little ball next to her until she turns off the light.
