		<h1> Today </h1>

		<p>When I’m not in the classroom or in the library, I’m either running around doing something for my sorority, Gamma Phi Beta. I’m currently the President and I was formerly the Financial Vice President so I guess you could say I’m invested in my sorority. I just want to do the best I can because I’ve gotten to know most of my friends through it! It’s also been a great avenue to do things in the community because I feel like it’s important to get out and get to know the real Rochester if I’m going to say I lived here for four years. That’s why I’ve also dabbled in community service programs here. Recently I joined a pen pal program hosted by the Student Association, and joined the executive aid committee to help plan the program. I’m also a member of Student Programming Board and that’s really fun because we get to plan huge events like concerts for students of the U of R.</p>
